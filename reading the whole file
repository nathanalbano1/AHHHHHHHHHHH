This Lab is about opening a file handle, and 
reading the whole file into a big string.

You can read a file line by line, or put the 
whole file in as a single string.  This is an example 
of reading the whole file using the file method: 
- file_handle.read() method
      ''')

# Challenge 1
print('''
Challenge # 1
----------------------------------------------------
Play with indexing the string to find the index 
location for "red pill" and print the location index 
and text "red pill" here:
      
Hint: You could find it by trial and error, or you 
could use a string method like .find()

# Open the file and read its contents
xfile = open('text-file-matrix.txt')
whale = xfile.read()

# Print the total number of characters in the file
print('Number of Characters = ', len(whale))

# Find the index of the phrase "red pill"
phrase = "red pill"
index = whale.find(phrase)

# Print the index and the text at that location
if index != -1:
    print(f'Found "{phrase}" at index {index}')
    print('Text at that index:', whale[index:index+len(phrase)])
else:
    print(f'The phrase "{phrase}" was not found in the file.')
